        I try to keep in mind that it's a long journey. It's not a race. It's about staying focused, continuing to do good work, make my family and community proud; that's all I really want to do... and pay my bills.

An original idea used as my final project for RefactorU to showcase my skills. StandUp utilizes the MEAN Stack for the backbone of site, Twitter Bootstrap for the grid system, TokBox API for live video streaming, and websockets to make everything real time.</p>

                    <p>The ZONE project was part of the GiveFirst Hackfest put on by TechStars. My team, consisting of two other people and myself, volunteered to take on the project of creating an entire online presence for a non-profit located in Denver. This site included a e-commerce store, blog, and donation page. We had a total of 20 hours to complete this project. My direct part in this was designing and building the home page as well as helping out others.</p>

This project introduced me to all the beatiful and fluid animations that Google Material has created. These beutiful animations created by Google paired with Angular has made me fall in love with Angular Material. Not only does it make great interactive sites for desktop, but it also excels on the mobile level as well.</p>
