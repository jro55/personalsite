        I try to keep in mind that it's a long journey. It's not a race. It's about staying focused, continuing to do good work, make my family and community proud; that's all I really want to do... and pay my bills.

                    <p>Stand up is a site built for stand up comedians as well as anyone who enjoys stand up comedy. An original idea used as my final project for RefactorU to showcase my skills. StandUp utilizes the MEAN Stack for the backbone of site, Twitter Bootstrap for the grid system, TokBox API for live video streaming, and websockets to make everything real time.</p>

                    <p>The ZONE project was part of the GiveFirst Hackfest put on by TechStars. My team, consisting of two other people and myself, volunteered to take on the project of creating an entire online presence for a non-profit located in Denver. This site included a e-commerce store, blog, and donation page. We had a total of 20 hours to complete this project. My direct part in this was designing and building the home page as well as helping out others.</p>
