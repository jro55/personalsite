        I try to keep in mind that it's a long journey. It's not a race. It's about staying focused, continuing to do good work, make my family and community proud; that's all I really want to do... and pay my bills.

                    <h3>StandUp!</h3>
                    <p>Stand up is a site built for stand up comedians as well as anyone who enjoys stand up comedy. An original idea used as my final project for RefactorU to showcase my skills. StandUp utilizes the MEAN Stack for the backbone of site, Twitter Bootstrap for the grid system, TokBox API for live video streaming, and websockets to make everything real time.</p>
                    <p>While this project was fun and I would love to fully complete it and make it live, other work has forced me to postpone this project until further notice.</p>

                    <h3>Solar System</h3>
                    <p>Solar System was a group project I did with several friends just to learn a new JavaScript library and further our knowledge. We utilized the Three.js library to create an interactive solar system. This project gave us a basic understanding of the library including how to utilize scenes and cameras in three.js.</p>

                    <h3>Dev Camp Grads</h3>
                    <p>Dev Camp Grads is a small for-practice project I choose to do to familiarize myself with the Angular Material framework. This project introduced me to all the beatiful and fluid animations that Google Material has created. These beutiful animations created by Google paired with Angular has made me fall in love with Angular Material. Not only does it make great interactive sites for desktop, but it also excels on the mobile level as well.</p>
